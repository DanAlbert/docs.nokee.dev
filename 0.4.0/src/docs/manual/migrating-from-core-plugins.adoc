:jbake-description: Learn about migrating existing native Gradle project from the newer core plugins to Nokee plugins for painless native development.

The Nokee project is a continuous effort for supporting the native ecosystem in Gradle.
The project is progressing very fast.
There isn't a clear cut migration path at the moment.
It would be best to connect and discuss your specific needs to establish a customized migration plan for your projects and your needs.
