> A workspace is an Xcode document that groups projects and other documents so you can work on them together.
>         A workspace can contain any number of Xcode projects, plus any other files you want to include.
>         In addition to organizing all the files in each Xcode project, a workspace provides implicit and explicit relationships among the included projects and their targets.
